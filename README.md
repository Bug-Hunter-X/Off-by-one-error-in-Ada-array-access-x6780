# Ada Off-by-One Error Example
This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Ada programming that arises from incorrect array indexing. Ada uses 1-based indexing, meaning the first element of an array is accessed using index 1, not 0.

The `bug.ada` file contains code with the error, and `bugSolution.ada` shows the corrected version.  This is a simple but illustrative example of how easy it is to make this mistake.
